while will execute only if condition true
do will will execute for 1st time without condition check then only it will check for the condition*/

/*âœ… What this does:

a = 0

The while(a > 0) loop never runs because a is 0.

The do...while loop runs at least once, increments a from 0 to 5.
1, 1<5, pass then will again go to do loop, will not got to while loop.

Final console.log(a) prints 5.*/
