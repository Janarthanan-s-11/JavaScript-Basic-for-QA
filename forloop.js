//when to you use it, if we know how may times it going to execute then we use for
//for is similar to while loop.


// in while, we will give condition, initialize value and execute till condition, same is for()

for(let a=0;a<5;a++){
console.log(a) // will log value and then get increment. 0 1 2 3 4

}

//while support both condition and statement, for support only condition

let b = true
while(b){
    console.log(b)
    b = false

}
// true become false so loop will not execute 2nd time.
